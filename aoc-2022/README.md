# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Here you will find my solutions to Eric Wastl's Advent of Code. All of the solutions are in JavaScript. This repository will most likely take the form of a collection of scripts as I continue to use Advent of Code as a means of tinkering and expanding my computational thinking skills.
