# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Here you will find my solutions to Eric Wastl's Advent of Code.

This year all of the solutions are in JavaScript, and this repo will most likely take the form of a collection of scripts as I continue to use Advent of Code as a means of tinkering and expanding my computational thinking skill in 2023.
